moodle block for gradeup master's project

Gradeup is a block plugin that displays user grades as a burnup chart and course load heatmap

The Burnup chart displays the user's current grades as a percentage of total grade, and provides a projection for the user's final grade, as well as displaying the max possible grade the student can achieve, the minimum grade, and allows the student to enter "what-if" scenarios to help students make informed decisions with regards to time management/what they should focus on to achieve a desired grade.

The heatmap Chart displays the user's course assignments as a heatmap based on assignment weight. This graph allows the student to view their semester as a whole to get a better idea of when they earn different percentages of their grade. This allows students to plan when they need to focus their energy through the semester as well as whey they can "let off the gas a little bit".
